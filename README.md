# Sam — Software Engineer

I’m a software engineer focused on **building, launching, and maintaining
production products**. Most of my work is hands-on: writing code, shipping
features, fixing issues, and supporting systems after they go live.

I value pragmatic solutions, clear ownership, and systems that are easy to
operate and evolve.

## What I Work On
- Building backend services and APIs
- Developing product features end-to-end
- Launching new services and iterating in production
- Improving existing systems through refactoring and cleanup

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, Next.js
- Backend: Go, Node.js, PHP
- Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose
- Tooling: Make
- Delivery: CI/CD pipelines and automation

## Selected Experience
- **Product launches** — implementing services from zero to production
- **Backend systems** — APIs and internal services used in live products
- **Production ownership** — debugging, fixing, and improving running systems
- **Incremental improvements** — evolving codebases without large rewrites
